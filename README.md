# EMA Pingbot

EMA Pingbot is a web application for scheduling and implementing EMA survey studies. EMA Pingbot (or Pingbot) runs on a React/Flask/PostGres stack containerized in Docker. In addition the Pingbot application, you need a survey software (e.g. Qualtrics) and your participants will need to download Telegram to receive their pings.

## What is EMA? 
EMA stands for Ecological Momentary Assessment (also sometimes called experience sampling methodology or ESM). It is a research method that involves collecting real-time data from participants as they go about their everyday lives. By sending prompts (or “pings”) at various times during the day, EMA helps researchers capture in-the-moment experiences, behaviors, or feelings. This real-time approach reduces recall bias, provides richer data, and offers a more accurate picture of how participants think and act in their natural environments. A few common uses of EMA include:

 - Monitoring mood or emotions
 - Tracking health behaviors (e.g., diet, exercise)
 - Understanding how particular environments interact with thoughts, feelings, or behaviors
 - Delivering "just-in-time" interventions

 ## What is EMA Pingbot?
 
 EMA Pingbot is a tool that helps researchers set up and manage EMA studies. The application works in conjunction with the messaging app Telegram to deliver pings to participants that contain links to surveys in your chosen survey platform.

Telegram is a widely used messaging platform offering secure communication across multiple devices. By using Telegram, researchers can ensure that participants receive prompt and reliable notifications no matter what device they are using. Additionally, many people are already familiar with Telegram, making it easier and more comfortable for participants to engage with the study.

One major advantage of EMA Pingbot is that it allows you to use the survey software of your choice—such as Qualtrics, REDCap, or any other platform to design surveys and collect your data. This flexibility means you can continue leveraging your existing survey design and analytics tools while relying on EMA Pingbot to handle the scheduling and distribution of surveys to participants.
